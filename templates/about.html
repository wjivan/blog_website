    <h5>About Me</h5>
    <p>
        I'm currently an Economics Consultant at Frontier Economics. I have 6 years of experience working with data, econometric modelling, 
        and consulting with C-suite stakeholders. A lot of my work revolves around competition and antitrust - providing economic arguments 
        for litigation and regulatory law suits. As the size and complexity of the data I handle evolves, I am continuously upgrading myself 
        on the latest data science techniques. 
        <br><br>
        Outside work, I am especially interested in causal inference and network science and their applications to 
        solve social problems. I was a fellow at the Data Science for Social Good Programme organised by University of Chicago, Alan Turing 
        Institute and Warwick University. There, I used machine learning models to help the Paraguayan Government predict and detect fraudulent activities 
        in public procurements. I also do research at Cambridge University on topics of gender equality 
        and energy politics.
